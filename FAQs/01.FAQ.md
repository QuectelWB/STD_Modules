### QMI and GobiNet which one is better?

[A] Hard to say which one is better. The Qualcomm propose the GobiNet at first, and the QMI protocol came out later than Kernel 3.4. But the Linux Kernel varies considerably between 3.4 and 3.10. So for kernel version lower than 3.10, it's recommended to use GobiNet, otherwise you may meet build error with QMI driver. For those kernel version greater than 3.10, both GobiNet and QMI works fine.
