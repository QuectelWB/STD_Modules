#FAQ


### enter AT commands but no response get

[A] The AT instruction ends with '\r\n', each instruction has a response time, and input a valid AT returns OK normally.

AT 指令不响应，首先检查下格式，AT指令必须以 \r\n 结尾，或者以\r 结尾，\n 是肯定没用的。
AT指令有响应时间，规定时间内返回都是OK的。
PCIe模组敲AT指令没有返回，也可能驱动报错了，检查下驱动log。

###  Startup time of modules

[A] Normally it is 10 seconds. 大约是10秒。高通5G模组目前的开机时间较长，正常优化中。

### QMI and GobiNet which one is better?

[A] Hard to say which one is better. The Qualcomm propose the GobiNet at first, and the QMI protocol came out later than Kernel 3.4. But the Linux Kernel varies considerably between 3.4 and 3.10. So for kernel version lower than 3.10, it's recommended to use GobiNet, otherwise you may meet build error with QMI driver. For those kernel version greater than 3.10, both GobiNet and QMI works fine.

####Introduction

rmnet driver is used for supporting the Multiplexing and aggregation Protocol (MAP). This protocol is used by all recent chipsets using Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc. modems.

This driver can be used to register onto any physical network device in IP mode. Physical transports include USB, HSIC, PCIe and IP accelerator.

Multiplexing allows for creation of logical netdevices (rmnet devices) to handle multiple private data networks (PDN) like a default internet, tethering, multimedia messaging service (MMS) or IP media subsystem (IMS). Hardware sends packets with MAP headers to rmnet. Based on the multiplexer id, rmnet routes to the appropriate PDN after removing the MAP header.

Aggregation is required to achieve high data rates. This involves hardware sending aggregated bunch of MAP frames. rmnet driver will de-aggregate
these MAP frames and send them to appropriate PDN's.

#### Packet format

a. MAP packet (data / control)

MAP header has the same endianness of the IP packet.

Packet format::

	  Bit             0             1           2-7      8 - 15           16 - 31
	  Function   Command / Data   Reserved     Pad   Multiplexer ID    Payload length
	  Bit            32 - x
	  Function     Raw  Bytes

Command (1)/ Data (0) bit value is to indicate if the packet is a MAP command or data packet. Control packet is used for transport level flow control. Data packets are standard IP packets.

Reserved bits are usually zeroed out and to be ignored by receiver.

Padding is number of bytes to be added for 4 byte alignment if required by hardware.

Multiplexer ID is to indicate the PDN on which data has to be sent.

Payload length includes the padding length but does not include MAP header length.

Aggregation is multiple MAP packets (can be data or command) delivered to rmnet in a single linear skb. rmnet will process the individual packets and either ACK the MAP command or deliver the IP packet to the network stack as needed

	MAP header | IP Packet |Optional padding |MAP header |IP Packet |Optional padding |....
	
	MAP header| IP Packet| Optional padding | MAP header |Command Packet | Optional pad |...

rmnet userspace configuration is done through netlink library librmnetctl and command line utility rmnetcli. Utility is hosted in codeaurora forum git.
