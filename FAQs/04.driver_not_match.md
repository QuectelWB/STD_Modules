According to the USB protocol, the driver match which device depends on the USB descriptors.


Sometimes,you might see:

这种情况很常见，包括

	The option driver match all the USB interface, or no Net device, no net driver matched;
	ADB cannot work;
	Number of ttyUSB is wrong, even no ttyUSB device at all

Such as RG801, the correct one

But one customer saw his

Because Quectel have upgrade or change the feature or defination of the USB interface.


Please modify the opion.c as follow

    option_probe(
        ...
    if ((idProduct&0xF000) == 0x8000) {
                //HISI interface 0 is NCM
                if (bInterfaceNumber == 0)
                    return -ENODEV;
            }
        ...

The raw option.c

	bInterfaceNumber == 0 

be modified with

	bInterfaceNumber == 0 | bInterfaceNumber == 1

This is due to a change in the current RG80x USB interface descriptor functionality.There will be fully available network card drivers that can be compiled directly. Please contact Quectel FAE if you encounter this problem.

    option_probe(
        ...
    if ((idProduct&0xF000) == 0x8000) {
                //HISI interface 0 is NCM
                if ( (0 == bInterfaceNumber) || (1 == bInterfaceNumber)  )
                    return -ENODEV;
            }
        ...


You might see all all the Interfaces have been matched with option or qmi_wwan_q.


	lsusb -v

 ![](/imgs/lsusb_qmi-1.png)

	cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices

 ![](/imgs/usbdevices-qmi.png)

The interface should be matched with option, but it is matched with qmi_wwan_q.

I told him to build the kernel driver as kernel modules rather than builded in kernel.

Then try install option driver first, and install qmi_wwan_q later.

And then the problem was solved.

BTW, actully it is kernel 3.4, if he used GobiNet, no such problem would happen.
