## What is Quectel Modules ##



Quectel Modules is such a device that provides data communication for emmbeded devices with SIM cards and mobile network.
From the perspective of embedded system, the Quectel Modules is actually the Minimum System Core Circuit Board that can help the customers to set up data commnuction.


As the EMBEDDED operating system runs on AP and there are various peripherals interfaces (Uart/SPI/I2C/Audio/SDIO, etc.), the remote module can also be used as a processor. Customers can integrate and transplant peripherals and applications for some scenarios that do not require high processing performance and resources. The remote solution is called the Open solution.

由于嵌入式操作系统运行在AP上，有各种外设接口(Uart/SPI/I2C/Audio/SDIO等)，远程模块也可以作为处理器使用。客户可以为一些不需要高处理性能和资源的场景集成和移植外设和应用程序。远程解决方案称为开放解决方案。

Generally speaking, remote module is connected to another embedded processor through USB/PCIe/Uart, which is called Host AP, OR EAP, or External AP. Remote communication module is used as a device, and the driver required by porting module on Host AP is used. This scheme is called standard module scheme.

Quectel模块一般通过USB/PCIe/Uart连接到另一个嵌入式处理器（称Host AP，或EAP，External AP）。使用远程通信模块作为设备，使用在主机AP上移植模块所需的驱动程序。这种方案称为标准模块方案。
